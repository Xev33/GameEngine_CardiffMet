# Welcome to my game engine #
This game engine uses 2 APIs
* "Ogre3D" for the 3D rendering
* "Bullet" for the physic

### Project summary ###

The project has been made in 2 weeks.
Here is the game engine I produced for the eponymous module in the "Computer Game Design & Development" section of Cardiff Metropolitan University during the year I spent in Cardiff Wales.
This engine uses "Ogre3D" as 3D rendering engine and "Bullet physics" as physics engine.

The project has been submitted alongside with a Doxygen documentation and a written document summarising the game engine's architecture.
You can find this PDF here: 

### How do I get set up? ###

* You will need to provide your Bullet and Ogre3D lib folders to the cmake
* Then press play

### Code documentation ###

To see the entire code documentation:

* just go to the following folder: ```Doxygen/html```
* Search for a file named “index.html” 
* Double click on it 
* If asked: Select your internet navigator 
* Done! You should now have all our class attributes and methods with some inheritance trees.
